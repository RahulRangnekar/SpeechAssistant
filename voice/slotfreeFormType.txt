I have a dream that the world was good
My name is Malcolm X
Here is my speech from 1962
This is our example speech
This is an example of what you can practice with our skill
You can make mistakes
Nobody is perfect
Good luck with your speech and enjoy
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
I have a dream today
